## Project Overview

The **Smart Occupancy Management System** is a cloud-based solution designed to track building occupancy in real time.  
It initially began as a **QR-based entry/exit tracking app**, then evolved into a more **automated system** powered by **Supabase** for instant database updates, analytics, and real-time capacity monitoring.

The system helps organizations monitor room usage, manage crowd limits, and enhance operational efficiency with live tracking dashboards.
